# ray-traysing
Ray tracing technology in console using C/C++
This repository showcases the power and flexibility of ray-tracing technology written in C/C++. Ray-tracing allows for photorealistic rendering by simulating the path of light rays as they interact with virtual objects. Our implementation provides impressive visuals and efficiency, taking full advantage of modern hardware. Additionally, we offer easy-to-understand example code and comprehensive documentation, making it accessible to enthusiasts of all levels. Join us as we explore the exciting possibilities that ray-tracing has to offer.
